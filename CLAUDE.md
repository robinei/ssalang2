# SSA Compiler

## Building
Run `make` here in the roor repo directory to build the project.

## Testing
Run `make test` to run the test suite. Will build the project if necessary.

The test suite is simply all exported functions which have a `test_` prefix.
These tests are snapshot tests, and their corresponding snapshots are stored in the `snapshots/` folder.
Snapshots are simply a capture of stdout text generated by running the test function.
Snapshots should only be modified if the modified output is expected.
When a test fails the snapshot diff is printed on the lines following the line with the test name and the `failed!` status.
The diffs are generated with the Python difflib library, and will have usual `-` and `+` prefixed lines,
as well as ignorable `?` prefixed lines which show hints about what changed on the adjacent line.

## Debugging segfaults or memory problems
Use valgrind to debug for example specific test failures caused by memory issues:
```
valgrind ./bin/compiler --run-test test_instruction_scheduling
```
